The second press determines the size of the mouth
The third press determines the size of the locomotion

After three presses, your creature will enter the wild to fend for itself.
It must feast on creatures of other species in order to survive, but beware,
for others will try to feast on you.

If all your strain of creatures becomes extinct, you will fall out of the game.
Can you create the most resilient and ruthless creatures?
